This code is a GUI application built using Tkinter, a Python GUI toolkit, that allows users to generate images using a Stable Diffusion Model. The model used in this code is loaded from the Hugging Face model hub using an authentication token. Users can enter prompts in the text box provided, and when the 'Generate' button is clicked, the model generates an image based on the prompt and displays it in the GUI. The generated image can also be saved to the local system.
